# Context

The project's glossary: the terms it uses and what each means here, one entry per term.
nightshift's runs read this file and keep it up to date.

- **watch**: the long-running `nightshift watch` (the launchd service) that polls the watched
  repos and starts runs.
- **run**: one headless `claude -p` session working an issue, in the issue's worktree; it ends
  when the agent stops.
- **issue dir**: `~/.nightshift/issues/<owner>_<repo>_<n>/`, an issue's state (session, cost,
  log, pid, skill, pr).
- **stage**: where an issue is (questions, plan, build, update, merge…), shown by its
  `nightshift: …` label and the `<!-- nightshift:<stage> -->` marker on each comment.
- **ticket**: one vertical slice of an approved plan, built and committed on its own.
- **overlap markers**: `<!-- nightshift:after #N -->` and `<!-- nightshift:overlaps #N -->` in
  a PR body, the order PRs should merge in.
- **world**: a test's throwaway machine from `world()` in `scripts/test-lib.sh`, with the
  fakes in `scripts/fake/`.
